Omar Roa

## How difficult was this assignment?

It's been difficult.  I'm not making the connections in Angular yet.
I plan on doing some more reading and smaller examples during Spring break.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

I get the concept of the GET request, and understanding more of Angular, just need to learn more.


## How could this assignment be improved?

You helped us a lot with it, I think it is fine. I know that this is my issue.


## Any other comments?

While I'm frustrated I haven't finished this assignment, I'm hoping that I can catch up with the content over spring break.
